I've found this is much too slow for a busy controller. at PHX they often give headings; altitudes; altimeter settings in 1 transmission. they expect a quick response or are jumping on you for not listening up. usually there is no problem with responding and then setting equipment. if there is a lot of radio traffic; it makes it much more difficult to concentrate. I will be more diligent in checking altimeter settings on the Flight Management System in the future", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[1635, 1649], [1657, 1672]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 79], [80, 123], [124, 227], [228, 300], [301, 351], [352, 439], [440, 512], [513, 572], [573, 648], [649, 693], [694, 766], [767, 806], [807, 878], [879, 982], [983, 1038], [1039, 1117], [1118, 1178], [1179, 1212], [1213, 1296], [1297, 1344], [1345, 1456], [1457, 1529], [1530, 1559], [1560, 1704], [1705, 1842], [1843, 1988], [1989, 2090], [2091, 2187], [2188, 2250], [2251, 2310], [2311, 2392], [2393, 2465], [2466, 2521], [2522, 2603], [2604, 2676], [2677, 2748], [2749, 2832], [2833, 2933]]}, {"rid": "603810", "text": "ON the Fixed-Base Operator ramp ready to taxi to active runway. ground cleared our aircraft S on taxiway right to runway 8R. we taxied S on taxiway right about 200 yards and held short runway 8R. switched to tower and we were cleared right turn -- cleared for takeoff runway 8R.
