I then inquired if there was anything else that could be checked to troubleshoot this problem. we were told by maintenance control that the only other check they were going to do was the same check the mechanic had done for the PRE-departure; which involves powering up the hydraulics and accomplishing a normal control check. this check had been done prior to the crews' arrival and no problems were noted. the problem occurred after block out. the mechanic did as maintenance control instructed and the aircraft was signed off as ok to return to service.

I am concerned that there may have been pressure from maintenance control to accept an aircraft that was exhibiting the same problematic symptoms after the maintenance procedures were accomplished and no further investigation was deemed necessary. contributing factors in my decision not to depart included the very low weather and the hostile terrain surrounding the airport. after extended conversations; I was informed that we (myself and the First Officer) were removed from the flight and a management crew was being sent to rescue the aircraft.callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: the RPTR stated that maintenance operations was contacted by the RPTR and after relating the rudder actions; the technician again checked the rudder operation with the same results; shuddering; rumbling; and vibration in the rudder pedals. maintenance operations made the claim the rudder operation was normal for a lightly loaded airplane and made it appear the rudder was moved rapidly during the test. the rudder inputs were slow and per procedure. the justification for this airplane being serviceable was a small footnote from the maintenance manual that had nothing to do with weight of the aircraft. the RPTR'S decision to refuse the airplane was tempered by the weather ; local terrain and the belief this airplane was not right .", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[63, 71], [3307, 3319], [3335, 3343], [4279, 4287], [4295, 4303]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 327], [328, 370], [371, 550], [550, 602], [603, 699], [700, 818], [819, 988], [989, 1060], [1061, 1131], [1132, 1251], [1252, 1362], [1363, 1485], [1486, 1557], [1558, 1625], [1626, 2007], [2008, 2123], [2124, 2218], [2219, 2450], [2451, 2531], [2532, 2569], [2570, 2680], [2681, 2787], [2788, 2990], [2991, 3238], [3239, 3367], [3368, 3848], [3849, 4013], [4014, 4060], [4061, 4215], [4216, 4347]]}, {"rid": "291995", "text": "DURING descent check; Captain found he had left fuel XFEED on (it was on to correct minor IMBAL). fuel IMBAL was in limits for INFLT but exceeded landing limits. we decided to lower all possible drag inducers (gear; flaps; speed brakes; etc) to burn as much fuel as possible to bring fuel closer to landing limits. landing was uneventful and I noted no unusual control inputs during approach and landing. fuel was out of limits for landing. the dim ANNUNCIATOR on panel WASN't as eye catching (I did not notice it before descent check) and I could have been more diligent in monitoring fuel balancing when Captain initiated it", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[43, 62]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 97], [98, 161], [162, 314], [315, 404], [405, 440], [441, 492], [493, 626]]}, {"rid": "154800", "text": "THE copilot has 5 YRS experience in his seat. the so is a retired air force pilot with about 2 YRS in his seat. this was the third day and 6TH leg of a 3 day trip . an observer of the first 2 days would have said we were a well oiled crew. our airline does a good job of training in and stressing Standard Operating Procedure'S; which we followed. crew interaction and application clear principles were quintessential. the so'S attention to detail and performance were as good and as professional as I have seen; easily in the top 10; looking back on 24 YRS with the airline. planned takeoff runway was 15; flaps 5; normal (reduced) EPR. ground control assigned runway 21.

I have flown international trips with crews that would have made mine look super alert. the airline companies refuse to address this problem. where fatigue may well have been a factor in an accident; it has always been discounted by the airline; the National Transportation Safety Board; and the Federal Aviation Administration. if my plane had ended up a smoking heap off the end of runway 21; it would have been written off as 100% pilot error; and once again the fatigue factor would have been ignored. I believe it was an air force study that showed that pilots on the back side of the clock were 60% effective. another study showed that pilots who were legally drunk were 75% effective. we have just witnessed the uproar caused by drinking pilots ; yet hundreds of FLTS operate nightly (BCT); where the crews are in worse shape; and nobody; not even authorities aware of the problem do anything about it. I am not suggesting that we stop night operations; but scheduling crews as we were scheduled; is irresponsible. our body clocks are on W coast time. our airline has crews based on the E coast that could have flown those early morning departures. just as W coast crews could fly late night W coast departures. that ISN't a factor in building schedules; minimizing crew cost is. it will take National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National Transportation Safety Board; and the Federal Aviation Administration; to build rules that prohibit the type of scheduling that puts crews on FLTS that are more impaired then if they were legally drunk. my submission of this report is not prompted by the fear of Federal Aviation Administration sanctions; no one knows of this occurrence but the crew. I could have just forgotten about; as I am sure many other crews have. but the potential for disaster here is extreme. I suggest that National Aeronautics and Space Administration actively seek input from airline crews; domestic and international; concerning any occurrences which the crew attributes to fatigue ; and 'back side of the clock' scheduling. callback conversation with reporter revealed the following: RPTR described his schedule during this flight and pointed out how it contributed to his crew'S fatigue . he pointed out just how the so entered the takeoff data message wrong and missed the fact that a 5 degree takeoff is not permitted on runway 21. he said that; since this incident; he always checks the runway takeoff data himself", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[271, 280], [1622, 1636], [1667, 1686], [1688, 1704], [1706, 1722], [1756, 1798], [4195, 4205]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 45], [46, 111], [112, 164], [165, 239], [240, 347], [348, 418], [419, 575], [576, 637], [638, 672], [673, 762], [763, 851], [852, 924], [925, 1061], [1062, 1252], [1253, 1300], [1301, 1328], [1329, 1411], [1412, 1518], [1519, 1604], [1605, 1799], [1800, 1924], [1925, 2018], [2019, 2113], [2114, 2277], [2278, 2352], [2353, 2465], [2466, 2553], [2554, 2607], [2608, 2794], [2795, 2971], [2972, 3081], [3082, 3157], [3158, 3375], [3376, 3487], [3488, 3524], [3525, 3621], [3622, 3684], [3685, 3752], [3753, 4027], [4028, 4176], [4177, 4247], [4248, 4295], [4296, 4531], [4532, 4697], [4698, 4842], [4843, 4926]]}, {"rid": "745836", "text": "THE local control #2 position and local control #3 position at las (las vegas tower) are being combined due to lack of staffing . the LC2 position controls aircraft landing the n S runways (runway 19L/right). the LC3 position controls the class B airspace assigned to the tower at las. the LC2 and LC3 position being combined contributed to a recent Operational Error where a citation was crossing the runway while an air carrier was departing the same runway. the 2 position are inherently different and should not be combined. the LC2 position is responsible for the runways (19L/right). the LC3 position is responsible for the airspace. the scans required for each position detract from one another. the controller working LC2 primary scan should be the runways; while the controller working LC3 has a primary scan on the radar scope and the B airspace. combining these 2 position is dangerous and has already contributed; at least in part; to 1 Operational Error . the ability to combine like position at las tower is available and should be utilized", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[350, 368], [949, 967]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 129], [130, 208], [209, 285], [286, 460], [461, 528], [529, 589], [590, 639], [640, 702], [703, 856], [857, 968], [969, 1054]]}, {"rid": "538175", "text": "PROB: incorrect taxi route from transient parking to the active runway resulted in runway incursion. no traffic conflict resulted. taxi clearance did not specify a route; so I proceeded to the active via most direct route. snow bank obstructed the runway intersection; so I taxied onto the active; then proceeded down the runway (back-taxi). tower observed this and issued clearance to taxi on the active and make a 180 degree turn at the departure end. at this point; I realized the taxi error.

I used my familiarization with the area'S ground lighting to determine that we were approaching the SMX-SBP area. also; I determined that due to our close proximity to the area that we needed to start a descend rather quickly. otherwise; we could not have been able to meet the LTT'S descend limitation of a maximum 1000 Feet Per Minute rate of descend and still be able to maintain a reasonable speed to the airport. I asked Air Traffic Control for a lower altitude and was assigned to 7000'. in my opinion this altitude was still too high to meet the LTT'S limitation so I started looking for the airport in order to be assigned a visual approach and unrestricted lower altitude. when approaching the SMX-SBP area from the S; SBP is the last cluster of lights sighted before continuing to the n. both the Fahrenheit/O and I sighted an airport beacon in what appeared to be the last cluster of lights. we both assumed this to be SBP so I called the airport in sight to Air Traffic Control. (we actually could not see SBP because of reduced visibility . I estimate flight visibility at approximately 20-25 mile. we did not realize this at the time.) we were approximately 35-40 mile away at the time of the call but Air Traffic Control still issued a visual approach W/O questioning as to whether or not we really had the airport in sight. the Fahrenheit/O that I was flying with was one that I considered to be above average so I was reliant on him to judge distance; speed; etc; and to set us up for a normal left traffic pattern into the airport. I focused my attention on calling and completing the descend check; calling for current weather ; setting up the radios for a localizer back up and looking out for traffic and the terrain . we were approximately 4000' and on a high left downwind when I called; 'airport in sight; landing assured; cancel Instrument Flight Rules;' to Air Traffic Control. Air Traffic Control simply cancelled and wished us; 'good night.' because of the ease at which Air Traffic Control cancelled we were further Light Emitting Diode to believe that we were approaching the correct destination airport. at this point several consideration should be made as to why the controller did not question my radio call: from our position 30 mile SW at 4000'there was no way that I could have seen SBP even during daylight unlimited visibility as the airport is surrounded by hilly-mountainous terrain ; 30 mile out at 4000' in no way assured us of a successful landing at SBP; the Fahrenheit/O had slowed the aircraft down to our final approach speed of 120 Knots ( unusual for the LTT until short final during Visual Flight Rules operations); and we were no longer heading to SBP but directly to SMX. however; the controller cancelled W/O any hesitation or questioning. in fact; the controller gave us an audible impression that he was relieved because he no longer had to deal with us. at approximately mid-field left downwind I started making position RPTS on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency and tried to identify the localizer. I could not receive the IDENTIFIER and assumed that we were in the non-receiving area of the localizer. because of this I commented to the Fahrenheit/O that the localizer would probably come in after we turned OPS Base Operations Office leg. both crew members were very familiar with the hilly-mountainous terrain surrounding SBP. accordingly; our attention focused on the ground lighting as that was all we could see of the terrain (it was a very dark night; no moon; no horizon; etc). both crew members continued throughout downwind and OPS Base Operations Office to concentrate on judging distance from these lights and looking for traffic with the Fahrenheit/O quickly glancing at the runway to judge his pattern work. after turning on to final I noticed that both the Horizontal Situation Indicator (Captain) and the OMNI-indicator (Fahrenheit/O) still had navigate/flags. I commented to the Fahrenheit/O that it was strange that the localizer still had not come in. the Fahrenheit/O gave no response as I gave my attention to the radios and again tried to identify the localizer. I considered the possibility of a navigate radio failure and rechecked; RETUNED the frequency; etc. I told the Fahrenheit/O that we still had navigate/flags as I started to scan the other instruments. no response was given from the Fahrenheit/O as I noticed that we were approximately 400'. I started calling out the 500' check. also; I briefly glanced outside during the check and noticed that both the approach lighting system (Automatic Landing System) and Visual Approach Slope Indicator were not on. I COMMENTEDABOUT this to the Fahrenheit/O but he did not respond. finally; the Fahrenheit/O looked over and noticed that he could not hear me speak. somehow; my hot -microphone switch was clicked to the off position (a common complaint from SFAR 41 LTT crews!). the Fahrenheit/O reached over to the left side of my control stick and turned the switch back on again keeping my attention to the inside of the cockpit. at approximately 100' and after initially calling AIRSPD and SINKRATE I started looking back outside and concentrating on the airport. I did not recognize the normal visual clues for SBP as the runway appeared to be wider and much longer and the ramp area was dark and not lit up as that of SBP'S. I tried looking for other clues but everything was moving rather quickly and was hard to identify. consequently; I asked the Fahrenheit/O if this really was SBP as I figured that he had been looking out at the airport since we had turned final. the Fahrenheit/O responded with a somewhat UNDISCERNING; 'I hope so.' at that point I decided the airport we were about to land at was apparently not that of SBP and called for a go around. unfortunately; the wheels touched simultaneously as I made the call for a go around. since the wheels had touched and I knew that we had enough runway to stop I aborted the go around and assumed control of the aircraft. during ROLLOUT my suspicions were confirmed as we both recognized the airport as SMX.

I spotted traffic on a runway 1R visual slightly behind us and I estimated we got no closer than 1 mile from him. there was no Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II Traffic Advisory or Resolution Advisory . the controller advised us of the fact that aircraft were landing on parallel runways and we acknowledged. on landing we were asked to telephone the controller", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[1588, 1612]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 130], [131, 211], [212, 245], [246, 369], [370, 509], [510, 558], [559, 595], [596, 683], [684, 821], [822, 918], [919, 995], [996, 1079], [1080, 1116], [1117, 1182], [1183, 1273], [1274, 1385], [1386, 1430], [1431, 1473], [1474, 1582], [1583, 1667], [1668, 1726], [1727, 1781], [1782, 1884], [1885, 1990], [1991, 2043]]}, {"rid": "188117", "text": "LNDG Instrument Landing System 31R; visual approaches 31L; arrival push. training developmental on local control. air carrier LGT x checks in; 15 mile final; says he was issued visual to 31L; when he was issued an Instrument Landing System to 31R. he is moving past Instrument Landing System 31R approach course and closing on company aircraft Y on visual approach to 31L.

the Captain called JFK tower and asked where the aircraft just ahead was going. the tower responded by asking if the WDB was in sight. the Captain said; 'no; but we have an LGT aircraft Y just ahead'. the tower then asked what runway the crew was making their approach to; and the Captain replied '31L'. the tower then said the aircraft Y ahead was a visual to 31L and gave instructions to fly 270 degree and maintain 2000 feet. only at this point did the crew realize their error. they had assumed they were cleared for an approach to 31L when they had been in fact vectored for 31R. the controller erred by not specifying the runway to be used. and the Captain erred by acknowledging contact with the WDB which to the controller implied the ability to complete a visual approach and the assumption of aircraft separation obligations. but the underlying fault which contributed to these errors was the chaos of the communications frequency . when a frequency is saturated and more and more instructions have to be issued to more and more aircraft; the tendency is to omit required transmissions; shorten phrases; omit READBACKS and make assumptions about pilots' and controllers' intentions. these communication discipline lapses lead to incidents. luckily; this incident resulted in no near miss; no evasive action; and no discomfort to the passenger on either plane. small screw-ups like this happen all day longitude in the new york Terminal Control Area. but any one of those incidents can start a snowball reaction which can quickly overwhelm the system'S capability to cope; since communication-wise; it'S already overloaded . in this day and age; aircraft need data link like Automatic Communications Addressing & Reporting System", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[73, 82], [449, 457], [1033, 1042], [1082, 1091]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 72], [73, 113], [114, 291], [292, 376], [377, 418], [419, 563], [564, 604], [605, 720], [721, 897], [898, 975], [976, 1055], [1056, 1092], [1093, 1182], [1183, 1322], [1323, 1550], [1551, 1633], [1634, 1872], [1873, 1962], [1963, 2031], [2032, 2126], [2127, 2208], [2209, 2311], [2312, 2507], [2508, 2738], [2739, 2884], [2885, 3008], [3009, 3172], [3173, 3425], [3426, 3501], [3502, 3537], [3538, 3617], [3618, 3672], [3673, 3738], [3739, 3841], [3842, 3966], [3967, 4019], [4020, 4184], [4185, 4373], [4374, 4480], [4481, 4730], [4731, 4787], [4788, 4907], [4908, 4997], [4998, 5171], [5172, 5276]]}, {"rid": "441572", "text": "ON our scheduled flight from ILN to FLL; the initial part of our clearance was ILN-CVG-IIU-VXV; thence on to FLL via various fixes. when setting up the Global Positioning System; both myself and First Officer missed noticing that ILN.FLL1 (our PRECOMPUTED flight plan) had IIU fix omitted and had us going direct VXV (volunteer) after CVG. while climbing out of FL220 towards our then assigned altitude of FL310; flying a course of 174 degree CVG-VXV (heading 177 degree); ZID asked us if we were proceeding direct to IIU.

I was flying the aircraft (First Officer) on Auto-Pilot. I noticed a conflict with a target on the scope which was about 15-20 degree right of center and showing 800-900 feet above us in a descent. as I mentioned it to the Captain we watched it for no more than a few seconds in order to get some sort of idea on its track; we saw that it was definitely going to be a conflict so I took the aircraft off of Auto-Pilot. from this point things happened very quickly. we were continually looking for the traffic. I rolled the aircraft slightly to the left to change the window position. the sun was fairly low on the horizon and we WEREN't sure of the exact clock location of the traffic. immediately after rolling left we received a Traffic Advisory with the target now at 6-7 Nautical Mile and only 600 feet above us. this was almost immediately followed by a Resolution Advisory descend; descend command of 1200-1500 Feet Per Minute. just after I initiated the descent the Captain visually acquired the traffic at about 1-1:30 O'clock position. it was directly in the sun from my view point and hidden by the window frame of the aircraft. even though I had moved my head and the aircraft I was unable to see the traffic until the aircraft passed overhead. we descended from 5000 feet to 4400 feet at which time we received a monitor vertical speed. approach control never called this traffic out to us. we told them that without Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II it would have been a Near Midair Collision. my observations from this event: first I was uncomfortable seeing a traffic threat and not really being able to do anything about it until Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II gives us an avoidance maneuver. as an ex-fighter pilot I want to move the aircraft to miss the traffic horizontal not just vertical. procedure says we SHOULDN't do this. I think this is wrong we need that capability. we DIDN't have time to query approach control about the traffic . from the time we recognized it as a treat and the Resolution Advisory was made was less than 15 seconds. during this time we are visually trying to find the traffic. second Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II needs to be integrated with some air to air radar capability that will give us better target azimuth. this case the traffic was 10-15 off from where we actually finally saw it. I notice Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II does trail the ACFTS actual location. also knowing closure rate of traffic will also help. radar would do this.

I checked brake pressure on the brakes and got a normal feeling. on the LTT this is a method to determine if the landing gear is locked down. we also asked the tower controller if we had our landing light on. tower indicated they only saw one; left side off . landing light on is also an indication that your landing gear is down and safe; however the light not being on may have been burned out. other than the light out all indications were the gear was down and safe. just prior to t/D our left landing gear went unsafe.

I had IDENTED it as 21 mile E of bradley. upon reaching WITNY; I noted my time as XB07 local Eastern Daylight Time. although I was conducting the flight Visual Flight Rules and using a current Visual Flight Rules sectional; which expires 6/88; I was also trying to practice navigate along victor ARWYS with my current commercial en route chart; effective 3/88. I became temporarily disoriented when I checked the sectional for WITNY intersection and was unable to find it. this was due to the fact that V419 is a new ARWY and not depicted on the current Visual Flight Rules sectional. it is also not listed in the Airport/Facility Directory nor is it included in any NOTAMS (FDC or class ii inclusive). upon relocating myself I determined my position to be approximately 1-2 mile NE of swift airport (private). I did a 360 degree turn to the E while listening to the bradley Automatic Terminal Information Service. after circling 2 or 3 times; I tuned bradley VFR Omni-Directional Radio Range into my #1 navigate and centered the needle. noting that I was on the 120 degree right; I called bradley approach on 125.8 as published in the Airport/Facility Directory; told them I was 20 mile se of the airport. they asked me to repeat my position (which I did). they then asked that I recontact them on 125.65. I tuned to this frequency and suddenly realized I had forgotten the letter IDENTIFIER for the Automatic Terminal Information Service. worried of their response to this; I circled again while listening to the Automatic Terminal Information Service. I noticed again the airport below me. I still assumed this to be swift airport. other visual references I used to confirm my position were the city of hartford; just visible on the horizon to the SW; and the city of springfield; ma; to the NW. I then turned to a heading of 300 degree; centered the OBS and called bradley on 125.65. again; I gave my position as 20 mile se. they told me to squawk 0427 and identify. after SPEAKINGWITH other aircraft he told me he did not have me in radar contact; but did not tell me to remain outside the ARSA. I recycled my transponder and held my heading; awaiting further instructions. as he spoke with other aircraft further; I saw the connecticut river (located 4 mile E of the airport) about 5 mile ahead. I gave approach this position report. it was at this time they began to sound concerned of my position in the ARSA. he told me that he still did not have me in radar contact. I recycled my transponder again. a couple of minutes later I RPTED I was approaching the river and had jet traffic in site on final approach to my left. they informed me at this time that I had busted the ARSA and was in violation. I told them I was about to cross over the top of the airport and asked for further instructions. they asked for a position report about 2 minutes later and I told them I was 1 1/2 mile W of the end of runways 6 and 15. they gave me a vector 50 degree to the left to confirm radar contact which was then made. when I was 25 mile SW of the ARSA; they told me that radar contact was terminated; squawk 1200 and to call the approach supervisor at windsor locks when I reached my destination airport. I did call when I arrived and told him that I did not intentionally violate the ARSA; that I believe I had been misplaced when I made my initial call; and judging from the length of time it took me to reach bradley from my initial call; and after looking more closely at the Visual Flight Rules sectional when I landed; I was probably over ellington airport and not swift as I had originally thought. this would have meant I was 6 mile closer to the ARSA than I thought; but still not within the 10 mile inner circle; and therefore not in violation of the regulations. if I had been using flight following (as suggested by the tower supervisor) they would have turned me over to bradley approach at the appropriate time. the tower supervisor was upset that I had believed an initial call from 20 mile outside the airport to be sufficient and told me that a call further out would have been proper procedure. I should have tuned the Automatic Terminal Information Service before arriving at WITNY intersection. though I cannot be sure; I believe the circling might have contributed to my disorientation . also; I should have written down the letter identify for the Automatic Terminal Information Service or just called approach and stated that I had the current Automatic Terminal Information Service upon my second transmission. more updated and thorough NOTAMS/better correlation between Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules charts would have helped to better identify my position. finally; I believe the request to remain outside the ARSA should have been made when no radar contact could be established. if approach had done so; I would have remained outside the ARSA until contact could have been made or arranged to go around the ARSA if necessary. in the future I will request specific instructions if radar contact is not established on my initial call.

the pilot of aircraft x requested to remain on the original Air Defense Identification Zone squawk code. this request was denied. complying with the Air Traffic Control request; the pilot changed transponder code to 1200 and descended over site #6 to conduct the photo mission. at the conclusion of the photo mission over site #6; aircraft x climbed back up to 1500 feet; continued to squawk 1200; and came up on frequency 126.75 and informed the new controller of our intention of continuing the flight by proceeding to site #7 DCA 355 at 9 Distance Measuring Equipment as instructed by the previous controller (134.2). after initially responding that he could find no paperwork for aircraft x;

the pilot made the call and was informed that Air Traffic Control was submitting a pilot deviation report to the Federal Aviation Administration enforcement office citing a violation of the Air Defense Identification Zone (entering Air Defense Identification Zone on a 1200 code). the problem arose as a direct result of the 134.2 controller not granting the pilot'S request to remain on the original Air Defense Identification Zone squawk code ; and then compounded the error by failing to adequately hand off the flight to the controller on 126.75. the problem was discovered on 126.75; and he assumed that the pilot was at fault (as opposed to Air Traffic Control). the pilot informed the 126.75 controller that he was complying with instructions issued by the previous controller on 134.2; but for whatever reason this information was not viewed credibly or even verified between the two controllers. contributing factors included location #6 being located just outside the Air Defense Identification Zone (hence the erroneous instruction from the 134.2 controller to the pilot to squawk 1200 even though he knew the flight would be continuing back in to the Air Defense Identification Zone after the photo mission at site #6 was completed) and the lack of communication between the controllers on this flight. poor low-level radio and radar coverage in this sector also contributed. corrective actions: it appears since the advent of the Air Defense Identification Zone and FRZ flight restrictions (in the DCA metropolitan area) after 9/11; the potomac Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility has not been adequately staffed or equipped to manage the enormous workload imposed on them by having to track General Aviation Visual Flight Rules FLTS operating in the region. the increased workload has significantly contributed to the many mistakes made by the controllers handling aircraft in the region. unfortunately the pilot is more often than not assumed to be at fault when a perceived transgression has taken place; and assumed 'guilty' until they can prove themselves innocent . one final thought; clearly the controller on 126.75 eventually 'found' our flight plan paperwork since he did issue us a new squawk code; cleared us on course (inside the Air Defense Identification Zone) and then cleared us to site #7 in the DCA FRZ (flight restricted zone) -- the most heavily guarded airspace in the us. since this clearance would have never been provided had we not been on an approved Air Defense Identification Zone and FRZ WAIVERED flight plan; it is apparent that Air Traffic Control was well aware of our intentions on departure from HEF; en route from IAD to site #6; became confused between sites 6 and 7;then granted us clearance into the FRZ. the conclusion;

I never got close enough to tell what type it was and tower said nothing about the other aircraft that I heard aside from telling us to abort. it appeared to be taxiing away from us and turned off the runway onto a taxiway moments after we aborted. ground was probably handling him. we turned 180 degree and back-taxied to the end. the Captain said a few words to calm the passenger; then we turned another 180 degree and departed normally. later the Captain and I discussed what had happened. he was unaware that I had been having headphone problems and thought that my missing tower'S call to abort was nothing unusual . considering the relative inexperience of First Officer'S at my airline; CAPTS are very used to covering many First Officer duties. he saw the cessna after I did -- despite my INATTN -- because he was concentrating on the takeoff roll. to both of us; it just seemed to appear out of nowhere after tower called. in reality; there was little danger of a collision. even though we were close to V1; a 1900 can stop very quickly. if tower HADN't called; we would have been well airborne by the time we got to the cessna", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[3106, 3128]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 90], [91, 217], [218, 234], [235, 380], [381, 476], [477, 525], [526, 905], [906, 945], [946, 982], [983, 1041], [1042, 1208], [1209, 1374], [1375, 1518], [1519, 1548], [1549, 1620], [1621, 1736], [1737, 1803], [1803, 1889], [1890, 2034], [2035, 2100], [2101, 2251], [2252, 2323], [2324, 2361], [2362, 2379], [2380, 2466], [2467, 2520], [2521, 2609], [2610, 2715], [2716, 2749], [2750, 2798], [2799, 2907], [2908, 2960], [2961, 3089], [3090, 3220], [3221, 3324], [3325, 3399], [3400, 3451], [3452, 3514], [3515, 3604]]}, {"rid": "137196", "text": "FLT from TOKYO-san francisco; 2/90 was in the #1 position for takeoff on runway 34 at new TOKYO international (narita) airport. the weather was Instrument Flight Rules with 3000 visibility ; rain and mist with a wind of 350 degree at 17 Knots. it was the copilot'S leg. a wide body aircraft had just landed and the three crew members heard the tower transmit 'air carrier-identification cleared into position'. the Captain acknowledged the transmission and the Fahrenheit/O taxied the aircraft onto runway 34 and set the brakes. after a short time the tower asked what is the position of air carrier the Captain replied that air carrier was on the runway. the tower then gave another aircraft a go around that was on approach. the crew discussed the transmission and all felt with certainty that our aircraft had been cleared into position. my only thought upon reflection upon the incident was that the tower operator may have made a comment for our aircraft to continue to hold. one of the ironies of this incident was that all three cockpit members had read the dec 89 callback about 'what is your position' when flying international.

I drained fuel from the sump under the engine cowling on the ground and checked it for evidence of water contamination. none was present or found. this was consistent with there being absolutely no trace of water contamination in the fuel sample taken from the wing drain. (this last fact; in retrospect; should have alerted me to the fact that there was probably water in the form of ice in the fuel system because this particular aircraft normally harbors at least a small amount of water in the fuel tanks.) the operation of that fuel drain is from the pilot station in the cockpit. I was; therefore; unable to verify the specific flow or volume of the sample taken. the aircraft was covered entirely with a light to moderate coat of frost and it took me about 25 minutes to remove or reduce the frost on various parts of the AIRFRAME to the point where I deemed it safe for flight. on this particular morning; however; I did not have the ability to preheat the aircraft in any way. while this is not a specific requirement listed in the flight manual for the aircraft; I now believe that I should have done this. I experienced difficulty starting the engine; more difficulty than I would have expected or had experienced with this aircraft previously. the engine would fire a few times and try to start but die with the application of throttle. I now believe that the problem that I was experiencing was most probably due to a fuel flow problem created by a small amount of ice contamination of a particular fuel line. (the second warning flag that hindsight strongly suggests I ignored.) the suspect fuel line on the 100 series cessna is one that is located immediately after the fuel selector valve where it establishes the lowest point in the fuel system. I know that cessna provides a kit SK132-13A for the C150 and C152 aircraft and I know that later model C172'S come with the kit from the factory. the RUNUP and takeoff were in all aspects normal. I climbed and leveled off at approximately 3000 feet. about 7 or 8 minutes later; however; my attention was drawn to the fact that I was slowly but progressively losing power ; it was when I discovered that I had the throttle in the full open position and was not achieving full power that I realized that I had a problem. my first thought was carburetor ice and so I deployed the carburetor heat mechanism with the effect that the engine immediately lost power entirely. I then reversed that action; but to no avail as the engine continued to windmill without developing power. I then deployed carburetor heat again and left it that way for the rest of the flight. my situation at this time was dire in the extreme. but I was at least very familiar with the terrain both from the air and the ground where I frequently drive. it was still completely dark . below me on the ridge tops at this point were the small towns or wheeling suburbs of bethlehem and mount olivet; WV. the ohio river valley that I was slowly descending towards was wrapped in a deep thick eerie predawn fog . ahead I could see a thinning or partial clearing in the fog and the lights of 2 interstate HWYS became distinctly visible. at this point I tried the engine primer and for perhaps 2 or 3 slow strokes I did get some positive results momentarily as the engine began to develop some power. then the primer system itself seemed to stop working. I now believe that it too was starved of fuel although the fuel gauges indicated fuel in the tanks and I knew from the PREFLT inspection that I had confirmed that fact. I was probably at an altitude of 800 feet above ground level. 2 interstates were visible to me (interstate I-470 and I-70). the traffic was moderately heavy on I-470. I then realized that the area of I-70 I was considering had a rest area or weigh station that looked to provide a safe haven once I was on the ground. also; I recognized the area as one that I had frequented as a helicopter pilot. in addition; this particular area and stretch of interstate happened to be one that I had recently scouted out in detail from both the air and ground in order to provide helicopter approach and landing information. my knowledge and experience as a glider pilot helped me to maneuver between the overhead lights on the highway. I executed a normal landing; sequencing myself into the traffic that was at that hour of the morning; mercifully light. I taxied (power off ) just beyond the W exit of the weigh station and stopped as Federal Aviation Regulation to the right of the highway as the landing gear and obstructions would allow. with approximately 38 feet of wing span; the left wing; however; still infringed upon or obstructed the right lane of the interstate highway. the left wingtip was absent any light that would be visible to warn oncoming traffic. I recognized at this juncture that the situation was now equally; if not more perilous than a few moments before when at 3000 feet the engine died. I deplaned and watched in horror as 2 automobiles passed under the wing of the aircraft at high speed. the security of the situation deteriorated even further as passers by began to stop on the highway and get out of their vehicles to offer assistance. in short; I felt that I was sitting on a time bomb that would eventually explode with disastrous consequences when the first large truck or delivery van came down the highway in the right lane. a cursory examination of the aircraft revealed no problems that would preclude the engine from running and I resolved to try to start the engine again. the engine started and ran normally in all respects. a magneto check and a static check and a carburetor heat check of the engine all proved normal. under these new circumstances that I was then confronted with I felt that I had no choice but to depart. while one of the motorists who had stopped by the road side signaled that all was clear and there was a complete lull in traffic; I applied full takeoff power and after a slightly prolonged high speed taxi on the highway of approximately 2/10 of a mile. I made a normal takeoff and flew to the closest airport which was wheeling-ohio county airport (HLG). an inspection of the aircraft by another mechanic revealed no problems with the aircraft or the engine. he RPTED that there was a small amount of water present in both fuel tanks. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR said that if he had the newer type 172 that had the SK132-13A kit installed he probably would have been alerted to the problem of ice lying within the lower fuel line since he could have observed the flow of fluid from an outside line drain. this kit allows the exterior draining of the lower fuel line. this kit connects to that line at a point between the selector valve and the fuel bowl on the firewall. the fuel bowl is where the present interior drain system flows; but does not allow the pilot to observe or collect the fluid. his aircraft in this incident was a very early model 172; a rental aircraft. he believes that this kit should be an airworthiness directive from the Federal Aviation Administration for installation on older C172'S. he RPTED this incident to the Federal Aviation Administration and they did criticize him for the takeoff from the highway without prior notification. they then gave him a '609 check ride' taking particular notice of his PREFLT procedures", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[489, 493], [791, 847], [1582, 1586], [2418, 2422], [2822, 2830], [2913, 2918], [3138, 3142], [3200, 3204], [6653, 6657]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 103], [104, 223], [224, 250], [251, 376], [377, 614], [615, 689], [690, 773], [774, 989], [990, 1089], [1090, 1220], [1221, 1359], [1360, 1452], [1453, 1626], [1627, 1696], [1697, 1866], [1867, 1941], [1942, 2012], [2013, 2062], [2063, 2116], [2117, 2385], [2386, 2534], [2535, 2641], [2642, 2728], [2729, 2779], [2780, 2888], [2889, 2919], [2920, 3036], [3037, 3143], [3144, 3266], [3267, 3429], [3430, 3483], [3484, 3652], [3653, 3714], [3715, 3776], [3777, 3819], [3820, 3857], [3858, 3970], [3971, 4050], [4051, 4265], [4266, 4377], [4378, 4497], [4498, 4684], [4685, 4826], [4827, 4912], [4913, 5060], [5061, 5163], [5164, 5313], [5314, 5507], [5508, 5659], [5660, 5712], [5713, 5808], [5809, 5913], [5914, 6167], [6168, 6269], [6270, 6373], [6374, 6449], [6450, 6764], [6765, 6826], [6827, 6930], [6931, 7056], [7057, 7133], [7134, 7263], [7264, 7271], [7272, 7333], [7334, 7421], [7422, 7509]]}, {"rid": "292697", "text": "WHILE making a visual approach to runway 26R at den; approach control told us to follow another aircraft that was making a visual approach to runway 26L and land on runway 26R. they also told us to follow him as close as possible but; not to pass. the terrain surrounding the runways was covered with snow . while monitoring the preceding aircraft; we lined up on the taxiway between runways 26L and 26R. this error was recognized by both the cockpit crew and the tower simultaneously. a go around was initiated just as the tower was advising the crew of the error.", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[252, 260], [301, 306]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 247], [248, 307], [308, 485], [486, 565]]}, {"rid": "145044", "text": "I was in the process of landing at kent state university airport with a left crosswind. my approach was not very good --overshooting the runway on turn to final.

I checked weather for the flight to FAI; which showed Visual Flight Rules for departure from barrow; Instrument Flight Rules conditions over the brooks range en route; and Visual Flight Rules in FAI. Pilot Reports were not available; but the briefer said to expect to be between layers en route. I filed an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan along V444 from barrow (BRW) to bettles (BTT) to fairbanks (FAI). meanwhile; a ground heating unit was applied to the aircraft. after start; I noted the attitude indicator functioning perfectly and the heater putting out lots of heat.

I climbed to 13500 feet Mean Sea Level planning to contact Flight Service Station and refile along V444; which was now to my right. ARAKTRUK pass RPTED 3/4 mile visibility and bettles was Visual Flight Rules; so I headed direct toward bettles and started trying to contact Flight Service Station. at about this time; my crew hatch; located directly to my left; blew open. since I was single pilot; I set the Auto-Pilot and started working to close the door. I felt it critical to secure this door -- with outside air temperature approximately 25 degree below zero; I was worried about losing the attitude indicator with night approaching. after several minutes of struggling; I got the door closed. it was then that I noticed the aircraft'S altitude had changed and showed a descent through 4500 feet. I immediately applied climb power and XCHKED my position which showed me S of the highest peaks; and leveled off at 7500 feet; which is safe in that area. I started feeling strange. subsequently; I discovered that I was at 17500 feet and had apparently misread my altimeter. when I thought I was descending through 4500 feet I was actually at 14500 feet. I am convinced HYPOXIA and the cold ; coupled with my relative inexperience operating single pilot made dealing with the crew hatch problem even worse. fortunately; I was able to immediately descend; get the Auto-Pilot set up and get back on an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan. the rest of the flight was uneventful. contributing factors: while discussing the crew hatch problem with maintenance; I was told the problem was longitude-standing. I have had the door pop after takeoff before and was always able to close it quickly with copilot'S help. I have never had one open in cruise before. the confusion with operations regarding returning to barrow was a factor; causing me to cancel Instrument Flight Rules flight plan which would have kept me at 11000 feet the whole way. my disinclination to contact zan to re-establish an Instrument Flight Rules flight plan was based on rumor. I will call and file as the situation dictates from now on. lastly; after a rash of cold weather related problems in barrow; I was anxious to fulfill the company'S expectations. phone discussions with the company'S general manager and president that day made it clear the plane had to get to FAI. although the flight marked the beginning of an 11 day vacation; I honestly don't think 'personal get THEREITIS ' was a factor; as evidenced by my desire to take a functional plane 180 degree back to barrow.

I was shocked and offended but I tried to glean something constructive from the comment by thinking about being more aggressive and assertive while flying. the Captain also urged me to fly the airplane as fast as the gear and flap limits would permit. I did exactly what he asked for by flying at 180 Knots (gear down/extension and flaps 15 degree extension speed) to the derby outer marker on the Instrument Landing System runway 19 at CAK. at that point I called for 'flaps 15 degree gear down.' the Captain said; 'no' so I hesitated a couple of seconds to look at him in disbelief and said 'why not?' 'too close to OVERSPD;' he said. I reacted by bringing the power to flight idle as the Auto-Pilot had captured and was following the Glideslope down -- all the while we're starting to pick up AIRSPD. I estimated 1/2 way down the Glideslope the aircraft had slowed to 178 Knots. I again called for flaps 15 degree gear down; then confirmed 3 green gear lights and asked for flaps 20 degree; landing checks. at 500 feet above ground level the rain increased from moderate to heavy. I was intent upon not losing my scan but was thinking about locating and finding my windshield wiper 'on' button and pressing it. as we approached the 300 feet mark I momentarily looked up and pressed the button 'on.' 100 feet previous to that (400 feet above ground level) the Auto-Pilot had disengaged so I was hand flying it. as I looked up to press my windshield button on; the Glideslope began to descend and we moved 1/2 Department Of Transportation off course. this I know because it is what I saw when I looked back at the Electronic Flight Instrument System. the Captain then excitedly announced; 'I've got it' and took the airplane. he then positioned the airplane back in an attitude to make a landing but he had momentarily added power; then retarded it back to flight idle. he then announced 'ok; you've got it.' I said 'I have the airplane.' I took the controls and crossed the threshold. I remember thinking that being at VREF plus 20 Knots was a little fast and I thought that the tailwind of 9 Knots would not affect our glide and touchdown too much. I was in error on this judgement as I took the airplane and I landed well past the touchdown zone (approximately 1000 feet). at the gate; an airline pilot asked who was flying the airplane?' the Captain stated; 'the First Officer.' pilot; 'did you have everything under control up here?' Captain then replied; 'yes; it was under control.' airline pilot; 'I'Mach Number still going to call the Federal Aviation Administration because if that'S how you fly all of the time then it'S unsafe!' Captain then replied; 'everything was under control.' the flight back to ord was without incident. I don't think the Captain; who rarely flies the line and who ISN't a regular initial operations instructor; was prepared to trust me. there was a lot of confusion on my part as to why he DIDN't give me flaps 15 degree; gear down; because he had asked us to fly fast so we could make schedule. I'LL prevent this from happening again by flying slower (then I'Mach Number not trying to push the limit of the flaps and gear). I will add power and go around if the landing is out of the touchdown zone. this will also prevent me from breaking Federal Aviation Regulation 121.651 ever again. callback conversation with RPTR revealed the following information: RPTR flew with the company check airman on the following trip. she states that she was told that she was 'doing a fine job.' the First Officer has not flown with management since; but does not view her job 'positively' as a result of the rough beginning. the aircraft flown was a bae Airline Transport Pilot Certificate; Airline Transport Pilot Certificate. maximum takeoff gross weight is 50500 pounds and it is a low wing turboprop operated under part 121 (64 passenger seats)", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[2658, 2685]], "label-0": 1.0, "sents": [[0, 25], [26, 75], [76, 121], [122, 194], [195, 430], [431, 499], [500, 526], [527, 655], [656, 751], [752, 941], [942, 997], [998, 1136], [1137, 1303], [1304, 1381], [1382, 1509], [1510, 1583], [1584, 1713], [1714, 1801], [1802, 1857], [1858, 1912], [1913, 2051], [2052, 2056], [2057, 2151], [2152, 2226], [2227, 2370], [2371, 2409], [2410, 2439], [2440, 2486], [2487, 2557], [2558, 2651], [2652, 2707], [2708, 2776], [2777, 2842], [2843, 2939], [2940, 2990], [2991, 3007], [3007, 3141], [3142, 3195], [3196, 3240], [3241, 3374], [3375, 3533], [3534, 3662], [3663, 3738], [3739, 3826], [3827, 3957], [3958, 4019], [4020, 4149], [4150, 4252], [4253, 4373]]}, {"rid": "427213", "text": "IN sum: Certified Flight Instructor and student of SMA practicing touch and go LNDGS at SUS. 5 uneventful touch and go LNDGS with the 6TH planned to be a full stop. student made the approach and uneventful landing on runway 26. the surface of runway 26 was hard with some packed snow. the Certified Flight Instructor took control of aircraft on ROLLOUT in order to turn off at the taxiway most convenient to return to the Fixed-Base Operator for flight termination. during the roll and normal application of brakes; pilot discovered the right brake inoperative and with no help from aerodynamic braking; lost control of aircraft and ended up off the hard surface with aircraft momentarily tipped onto right wing before settling back onto normal attitude on all wheels.

I believe what happened was that I inadvertently read back another aircraft'S clearance. it seemed that the clearance she had just read was directed at us because just a second before I had requested a turn away from the weather ; but that transmission was probably stepped on by another pilot. the READBACK that I gave to approach'S clearance to a heading of 180 degree and 3000 feet was also probably stepped on. since approach did not respond to my READBACK; we thought it was the correct clearance. it would have been very prudent in a situation as busy as we were in to make sure that approach'S clearance was directed at us and not another aircraft. like I said earlier; it appeared that there was no conflict with any other aircraft and that there was very little time to ask the controller where the misunderstanding took place. she was very busy and did not seem very interested in pursuing the issue any further", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[158, 166], [177, 184], [275, 282], [365, 391], [469, 479], [888, 896], [1284, 1302], [1789, 1803], [1933, 1941], [2490, 2498], [2777, 2785], [3423, 3437], [3458, 3494], [3739, 3753], [3976, 3984]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 39], [40, 115], [116, 237], [238, 318], [319, 439], [440, 569], [570, 642], [643, 736], [737, 897], [898, 1007], [1008, 1069], [1070, 1159], [1160, 1317], [1318, 1407], [1408, 1475], [1476, 1583], [1584, 1691], [1692, 1804], [1805, 1942], [1943, 2119], [2120, 2161], [2162, 2232], [2233, 2327], [2328, 2499], [2500, 2610], [2611, 2730], [2731, 3065], [3066, 3213], [3214, 3252], [3253, 3288], [3289, 3403], [3404, 3576], [3577, 3754], [3755, 3843], [3844, 4049], [4050, 4169], [4170, 4257], [4258, 4410], [4411, 4591], [4592, 4676]]}, {"rid": "149918", "text": "WHILE conducting Instrument Landing System approach to runway 25L with side-step to runway 25R and on the g/S; approximately 8-9 mile out on localizer and on g/S. prior to seeing the runway and prior to commencing side-step maneuver; my aircraft was forced off of the localizer to the right to avoid hitting an SMT which suddenly appeared in my left forward WINDSCREEN at my 9:30-10 O'clock position in a left turn; belly up to me and closing. he was turning a longitude final approach to my runway and apparently never saw me. he was cleared to follow me; but apparently he was looking at another aircraft when he called a visibility on us. he never did get behind me and had I not deviated off localizer to my right; I would have hit him. my copilot saved the day by spotting him first. we were on an Instrument Landing System approach. he was conducting a visibility to follow us. he crowded me off the localizer! we were complying with all altitude and speed restrictions as depicted and requested. he appeared out of nowhere W/O warning by approach control who was supposedly monitoring the whole mess. approach never warned me at all!

we encountered icing at approximately 3000 feet Mean Sea Level and almost immediately received a bleed 1 OVERTEMP Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message. when we ran the Quick Reference Handbook and shut off bleed 1 as required; the OVERTEMP message went away. we reached dispatch and maintenance control to make the go/return decision. dispatch and maintenance control conferred and said we would be ok to continue to bos given the weather forecast. they told us to expect contract maintenance on the ground in bos for a bleed system 1 deferral. we asked if it would be safe to continue to bos; given the weather was Instrument Meteorological Conditions and had snow in the forecast; but dispatch and maintenance control said we could continue and deal with the problem on the ground in bos. at this point; we were too busy to verify the Minimum Equipment List items for single bleed operation. the dispatcher said there was no icing forecast in either bos or CMH and; therefore; the flight would be fine according to maintenance control. dispatch gave us fuel burn numbers for the continued flight at FL250. we were in level flight at 10000 feet above 50 mile or less from CMH at minimum AIRSPD in Visual Meteorological Conditions when the decision was made to continue. after my conversation with dispatch; the First Officer and I reviewed the CHKLISTS associated with single-bleed operation in possible icing conditions . there are several CHKLISTS for anti- icing failures due to low bleed capacity with the single-bleed operating. we discovered that with 1 engine bleed source deferred; we were not permitted to fly into known icing conditions according to the Minimum Equipment List. we reviewed the weather packet and found that there were forecast low ceilings and possible precipitation through most of the NE with temperatures around freezing at the ground for all RPTING stations. to the best of our knowledge; there was no place within our fuel range that would permit us to land without flying into known or forecast icing . it also occurred to us that wherever we landed we would not only face possible emergency anti- icing failures; but would additionally be stuck awaiting maintenance due to the 'no flight into known icing ' caveat in the Minimum Equipment List. after learning this new information; we called dispatch back for an alternate plan. we decided to return to CMH where we knew they had very thin ceilings and; even though we would be flying through icing to land; we had a known quantity to deal with rather than fly into a rain and snowstorm farther n. on approach to CMH we did receive a wing anti- ice fail message and had to configure the airplane for landing earlier than normal to ensure engine power and bleed air volume would be sufficient for anti- icing . we were in trace-to-light icing for less than 2 minutes before breaking out of the clouds on final and could see no residual ice on visible surfaces. the total flight time was about 2 hours from start to finish; and then only that longitude because it took the First Officer and I so longitude to get through normal flight duties and then review the other applicable system and Minimum Equipment List information. we flew through icing conditions single-bleed into CMH because; according to our best information; there was no place else we could go and land without encountering clouds and CMH was the best overall option. this flight had several issues. the first issue was MISCOM between me and dispatch. when we called; I informed dispatch that on departure from CMH we had received the bleed OVERTEMP; and we were INFLT trying to make a continue or return decision. dispatch did not correctly understand what I told them and told me in a later conversation they had assumed we were on the ground in CMH at the time of the call rather than 50 mile n of CMH at 10000 feet. another issue is that dispatch told us we could continue to bos because; as the dispatcher said; there was no forecast icing between bos and CMH. according to our weather RPTS in hand; all fields along the route were calling for overcast clouds with temperatures around freezing throughout the forecast period. there seems to be some misunderstanding for what constitutes known or forecast icing at the dispatch level. the last issue is that; as a flight crew; we were heavily task loaded with this problem and; therefore; took a while with our normal duties before we found THEPROB with flying into icing . if maintenance control had been more pro-active and had told us over the radio what the stipulations were for continued flight or for the operationally limiting Minimum Equipment List right at the beginning; we could have saved a lot of fuel and time by returning to CMH immediately or flying into a field that had more favorable non- icing conditions . in the end; we swapped aircraft in CMH and were able to accommodate all our original passenger and a few that had been XFERRED from another flight. we arrived in bos without further incident", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[35, 41], [465, 473], [638, 646], [661, 687], [695, 700], [961, 967], [1239, 1265], [1439, 1456], [1495, 1501], [1665, 1682], [1739, 1747], [1793, 1802], [1857, 1886], [2063, 2069], [2166, 2172], [2268, 2274], [2459, 2468], [2512, 2518], [2664, 2668], [2821, 2827], [2855, 2861], [2912, 2919], [2954, 2958], [3259, 3276], [3408, 3415], [4023, 4029], [4067, 4075], [4133, 4142], [4142, 4149], [4154, 4183], [4294, 4300], [4504, 4510], [4847, 4864]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 185], [186, 292], [293, 368], [369, 482], [483, 578], [579, 824], [825, 927], [928, 1071], [1072, 1141], [1142, 1304], [1305, 1457], [1458, 1568], [1569, 1722], [1723, 1924], [1925, 2070], [2071, 2313], [2314, 2397], [2398, 2828], [2829, 2978], [2979, 3103], [3104, 3242], [3243, 3414], [3415, 3451], [3452, 3483], [3484, 3535], [3536, 3698], [3699, 3879], [3880, 3903], [3904, 4049], [4050, 4214], [4215, 4322], [4323, 4511], [4512, 4865], [4866, 5013], [5014, 5056]]}, {"rid": "309733", "text": "WHILE taxiing from parking spot at tie-down;

I fly to PWK often and strongly suspect there may have been the usual ' bickering ' with ord for an Instrument Flight Rules release for the jet. whatever the reason; it appears the controller simply forgot about our arrival. radio calls were not responded to (as though he was talking to ord on a phone) and it is obvious he just forgot about us; for whatever the reason. when we did have to abort the landing; he at first failed to respond ; and then failed to inform me of the departing cessna traffic. this almost Light Emitting Diode to a midair collision.

RPTR also brought up the information that he felt that morale was at an all-time low as contract negotiations were still in progress and that the pilot group felt disenchanted with the management group", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [[270, 278], [841, 853]], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 84], [85, 150], [151, 225], [226, 348], [349, 541], [542, 686], [687, 758], [759, 951], [952, 1007], [1008, 1040], [1041, 1150], [1151, 1183], [1184, 1339], [1340, 1507], [1508, 1660], [1661, 1756], [1757, 1913], [1914, 2051], [2052, 2106], [2107, 2308]]}, {"rid": "565307", "text": "TWR was in a bad mood ; all too common.
