I learned since the incident that other airplanes have slipped/slid at the same intersection; so there may be a very slippery point on the pavement that should be looked at and/or advised the pilots through Notice To Airmen or company information sheet. another factor was the experience of the First Officer -- brand new; right out of training with less than 100 hours. he said later that he was 'a little' uncomfortable with the speed at which we entered the turn; but he never spoke up.

I had already told my Fahrenheit/O that because we were tired that we needed to be cautious and watch each other closely. I made the takeoff. the actual darkness after leaving the ground and all of the airfield lights and my own aircraft lights jolted me into realizing that I had actually made a takeoff after dark W/O runway lighting as required by 135.229B (2). the boundary of the runway was CLRLY defined by the Visual Approach Slope Indicator and taxiway lights and I may have in fact been legal; but another important fact keeps bothering me. I was flying in a tired state of mind. I was totally legal by Federal Aviation Administration rules governing part 135 commuter duty and rest periods. company schedules routinely require longitude duty days followed by reduced rest and again followed by longitude duty days. at the urging of the RAA (REGL airline association) the rules were recently changed to sep charter and commuter duty time rules under part 135. we fly demanding schedules with 8-12 legs per day. we fly a fast airplane with no Auto-Pilot and must make many quick turn AROUNDS between legs. in many YRS of military flying in much larger equipment I never experienced such a workload. while my physical ability to maneuver the airplane does not seem as effected; I find my decision making ability suffers greatly at the end of an exhausting day. being aware of this certainly helps and this incident will slow me down even more and be another valuable lesson. I think the crew and duty time regulations are the real culprits in this incident. as soon as I broke ground and made myself evaluate the situation I knew I was wrong and should have returned to the gate. in a more rested state; I would have recognized this on the ground. instead; I subconsciously rationalized the situation as safe (which it was) even though it broke a rule. I recognize that rules are there to make decisions like this cut and dried and take the responsibility for always insuring safety. on the other hand; a rule that allows the company to routinely schedule pilots into fatigue has to create some contempt for those same rules. just because the aircraft are smaller under 135 does not indicate a smaller workload than under 121. the whole duty time situation of part 135 commuter operation should be re-evaluated and no comparison should be made to part 121. these are totally separate environments. the safety of the public we transport should be the only prerequisite in developing safer rules. in the meantime; I will be ever more cautious and deliberate when approaching the area of fatigue.", "aspects": 1, "spans-0": [], "label-0": 0.0, "sents": [[0, 93], [94, 158], [159, 190], [191, 324], [325, 359], [360, 421], [422, 542], [543, 546], [547, 593], [594, 695], [696, 776], [777, 849], [850, 1011], [1012, 1120], [1121, 1153], [1154, 1181], [1182, 1329], [1330, 1381], [1382, 1474], [1475, 1519], [1520, 1684], [1685, 1806], [1807, 1826], [1827, 2049], [2050, 2152], [2153, 2234], [2235, 2273], [2274, 2385], [2386, 2509], [2510, 2653], [2654, 2704], [2705, 2798], [2799, 2891], [2892, 3052], [3053, 3166], [3167, 3249], [3250, 3439], [3440, 3544], [3545, 3675], [3676, 3817], [3818, 3918], [3919, 4048], [4049, 4089], [4090, 4186], [4187, 4285]]}, {"rid": "534488", "text": "I opened my Visual Flight Rules flight plan with clarksburg approach.

I had become confused by the visual cues on where cloverdale airport was located and where I was in reference to it. as it turned out; I was looking for the airport'S location in the city of healdsburg which is about 12 Nautical Mile S of cloverdale airport. the california airport book showed cloverdale airport between the 101 freeway and the russian river with lumber mills nearby. the healdsburg airport has similar cues (river; 101 and lumber mills) on the opposite side of the freeway. not finding a visual match for the cloverdale airport'S picture in the airport directory; I circled for approximately 35 minutes between windsor and healdsburg trying to spot the airport on the E side of the freeway.

I had left santa maria with full tanks and a weather briefing (have slip and Fixed-Base Operator verification) and my FLITESOFT computer calculations with DUAT winds inserted showed a do-able non-stop flight with plenty of reserve. not wanting to risk trying to make the sonoma county airport in the distance; I then looked for the safest place to put the plane down. while the engine still sputtered intermittently; I noticed a 45 feet wide clear patch of grass median between the n- and SBOUND 101 lanes. I cut what remaining power I had and flared to a landing on the soft grass. I was clear of traffic from both directions and was never in danger to motorists (see picture). there was no damage to the plane or me as well. after I landed and explained to stopped motorists that I was ok; I called 911 from my cellular phone to report what had happened. the CHP had already heard from passing motorists and I was told cars were already dispatched. when the CHP arrived; they made sure I had all the licenses and was a current pilot (I was) and had me call the supervisor at the oakland flight watch. I explained to him what had happened and that there were no injuries or damage and after leaving phone numbers where I could be reached; he said they would be in touch with me if they needed further information. I told the CHP initially that it would probably be best to winch the plane onto a flatbed truck and taken to the nearest airport. as they were checking on this; they found out that the wings would have to be taken off to narrow the plane as it went through the streets to the airport. they then asked if it could take off if I had fuel on the stretch of freeway where I was that was clear of power lines and bridges. walking off the distance from where I could run up the plane over to the first set of wires over the freeway; I determined that it was a more than adequate distance to take off from right there. the CHP then called for a fuel truck to come over from the sonoma airport. I bought 15 gallons of gas from the driver of the fuel truck and had the mud on the wheels of the plane hosed off by a fire truck called to the scene. I then did a run-up and accomplished a takeoff in the SBOUND lane of the freeway. I flew to cloverdale; spent some time with my brother and then flew back to santa maria that afternoon. interestingly enough; when we calculated our fuel burn after landing in santa maria; we had averaged 9.72 gallons/hour on the flight back with a tailwind. this was 15 percent higher than the 8.44 gallons/hour predicted by the flight software for a flight with a strong headwind factored in. lost: I realize now; I should have not just looked for the visual cues for my location. the russian river snakes along both sides of 101 all through that area with many lumber mills dotting the landscape. I should have kept navigating using XRADIALS from adjacent VORS and then begun looking down for an airport. I was unfamiliar with the area and the destination airport. this; coupled with the fact I was a low time pilot with my most recent cross country flight occurring in a rented plane in AUG/92. had I been a little calmer; I could have even asked for radar vectors to cloverdale from center after admitting I was lost. notwithstanding; there'S no excuse for getting lost in an airplane. out of fuel: I DIDN't know my own airplane. the fuel burn mentioned by the seller and that listed in the pilots operating handbook and even the default cessna 172 burn/hour figures used by the flight planning software are not and should never be substitutes for knowing your individual plane'S consumption of fuel under different flying circumstances. with hindsight; I could have merely divided the gallons used by the time flying of my short FLTS around my home area and had a much better handle on my plane'S gas usage for planning such a longitude cross country trip. I could have also had some training in fuel mixture leaning as I flew the trip full rich.
